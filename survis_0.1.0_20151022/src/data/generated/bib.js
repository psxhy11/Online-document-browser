        "abstract": "Bahasa is an identity of the Indonesian nation which grow very fast for the unifying tool of ethnic groups so that it can increase of foreigners' interest in learning Bahasa as a tool to achieve, politics, trade, art and culture, and tourism goals. Many foreigners want to learn Bahasa Indonesia by the following program of BIPA (Bahasa Indonesia untuk Penutur Asing). However, the learning program of BIPA class is still conventional. Games can be used as an alternative educational media for BIPA learning in changing conventional learning methods so that they can visualize real problems. An Android-based game called \"Asiknya Berbahasa\" is an educational game of BIPA basic level material which has 3 stages; easy, medium and difficult stage and be completed with 3D character models along with the animation. 3D modeling and character animation referring to the Game Development Life Cycle (GDLC) method consists of several stages of initiation, pre-production, production, testing, beta, and release. Testing on 3D models and character animation using a Likert scale shows approval of the average value result test",

        "abstract": "Games involving virtual worlds are popular in several segments of the population and societies. The online environment facilitates that players from different countries interact in a common virtual world. Virtual worlds involving social and economic interactions are particularly useful to test social and economic theories. Using data from EVE Online, a massive online multi-player game simulating a fantasy galaxy, we analyse the relation between the real-world context in which players live and their in-game behaviour at the country level. We find that in-game aggressiveness to non-player characters is positively related to real-world levels of aggressiveness as measured by the Global Peace Index and the Global Terrorist Index at the country level. The opposite is true for in-game aggressiveness towards other players, which seems to work as a safety valve for real-world player aggressiveness. The ability to make in-game friends is also positively related to real-world levels of aggressiveness in much the same way. In-game trading behaviour is dependent on the macro-economic environment where players live. The unemployment rate and exchange rate make players trade more efficiently and cautiously in-game. Overall, we find evidence that the real-world environment affects in-game behaviour, suggesting that virtual worlds can be used to experiment and test social and economic theories, and to infer real-world behaviour at the country level.",

        "abstract": "There are multiple courses in higher education today that expose students to elements of game studies, development, design, and associated research methods, but far fewer explore using games directly as a method for research creation. There are emerging themes in the field around curricular efforts that consider the role of games as a method to (1) advance research (broadly defined) through the act of making games; (2) use games as tools for doing research; and (3) creatively present research topics and findings through games. This paper presents a post-mortem analysis of two courses that were designed, developed, and offered to graduate students at separate universities with these topics in mind, describing their success, failure, and lessons learned. One of these universities is largely focused on doctoral students in game studies, while the other is focused on MFA students in game design, and both offer game-centric MA programs, and also opened these courses to other graduate students in related fields. By examining the design, development, and evaluation of these courses as a comparative case study, the authors provide a practical narrative of best practice in the emerging area of games as research creation tools and associated curriculum.",

        "abstract": "A game usually used as a synonym for entertainment also serves as an educational tool . Originally targeting the enjoyment, the meaning of the game has evolved to much greater conceptions and applications. Games require physical or mental or sometimes both the simulation. Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise, or otherwise perform an educational, simulation, or psychological role. Having to be built on some key elements, which are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction. Various strategies and algorithms such as path finding and decision trees, have been developed to simulate those interactions between the human user and the computer in front of him. In video games, artificial intelligence (AI) is used to generate responsive, adaptive or intelligent behaviours primarily in non-player characters (NPCs) similar to human-like intelligence. This paper makes a short analysis of those preferred techniques and suggest from the study and the outcomes, the efficiency of each . The paper also focuses on the heuristic function, implementation platforms and design guidelines of the various searching algorithms used in adaptive games.",

        "abstract": "Researchers and developers constantly seek novel ways to create engaging applications that are able to retain their users over the long term, make them desire to spend time using the application or go back to using it after a break. With this aim, video games can be an insightful source of inspiration, as they are specifically designed to maximise playing time, increase players' intentions of playing during the day or enhance their willingness to replay. In a gaming context, \u2018time\u2019 is an important factor for engagement because game designers can design the game time to retain players in the game environment. Drawing on social practice theory, which is increasingly used in Information Systems (IS) research, I conducted an ethnographic study in World of Warcraft (WoW) to understand how various temporalities are produced within a video game and the effects that they have on players' engagement. The findings show that game temporalities stem from the complex interaction between the design features of the game and the norms, routines and expectations that are part of the game practices. Moreover, these temporalities can engender temporal experiences that may stimulate engagement in various ways. The study contributes to IS literature by proposing a novel understanding of how time can be intentionally designed to sustain user engagement. Finally, it suggests that \u2018time design\u2019 in video games could inspire designs in broader IS contexts, such as in the gamification of online communities, crowdsourcing platforms and crowd working systems.",

It finds that the main areas of current academic research are in tactical and strategic decision making, plan recognition, and learning, and it outlines the research contributions in each of these areas. The paper then contrasts the use of game AI in academe and industry, finding the academic research heavily focused on creating game\u2010winning agents, while the industry aims to maximize player enjoyment. It finds that industry adoption of academic research is low because it is either inapplicable or too time\u2010consuming and risky to implement in a new game, which highlights an area for potential investigation: bridging the gap between academe and industry. Finally, the areas of spatial reasoning, multiscale AI, and cooperation are found to require future work, and standardized evaluation methods are proposed to produce comparable results between studies.",

From an artificial intelligence (AI) standpoint, playing CCGs consists of two interdependent tasks: deck-building and battling. This paper presents three deep reinforcement learning approaches for deck-building in the arena mode of CCGs. Our approaches are trained in self-play and differ in the handling of past information when drafting new cards for a deck. We formulate the problem in a game-agnostic manner and perform experiments on Legends of Code and Magic, a CCG designed for AI research. Considering the win rate of the decks when used by fixed battling agents, the results show that our trained drafting agents outperform the best ones available for the game and do so by building very different decks. We also reenact the Strategy Card Game AI competition and show that our best drafting strategy improves the win rate of a baseline competitor by 14.9 and 12.7 percentage points in the 2019 and 2020 editions. \u2022Deep reinforcement learning deck-building agents trained in self-play.\u2022Different ways of considering past choices when choosing new cards.\u2022A game-agnostic methodology extensible to many collectible card games.\u2022Approaches outperform state-of-the-art agents in round-robin tournaments.\u2022Additional analyses and reenactment of the Strategy Card Game AI competition.",
